# Connect 4 Game

This Java program implements the classic Connect 4 game. Players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to connect four of their own discs of the same color consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
## How to Play

- Players are represented by 'R' (Red) and 'Y' (Yellow).
- Enter your nickname when prompted.
- Choose a column to drop your disc by entering a number between 0 and 6.
- The game alternates between players until one player achieves a winning combination or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game or extend its functionality. You can modify player colors, or enhance the user interface.

## Terminal Colors

The program uses ANSI escape codes to display colored text in the terminal. Make sure your terminal supports ANSI color codes for the optimal experience.

## Rules

The winning combinations include horizontal, vertical, and diagonal alignments of four discs of the same color. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Playing against a Bot
If the name of the Yellow player is **Bot**, you can play a game with a bot.

## Restarting the Game

After each game, you have the option to restart and play again. Simply answer "Yes" when prompted. The game will restart with the same players and their chosen nicknames.
